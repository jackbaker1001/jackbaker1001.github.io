Jack S. Baker is a physicist specializing in quantum and classical computational physics, condensed matter theory, and machine learning. He earned his MPhys in Physics & Nanotechnology from the [University of Leicester](https://le.ac.uk/) and completed his Ph.D. in Computational Quantum Physics at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) & the [London Centre for Nanotechnology](https://www.london-nano.com/) under the supervision of [Prof. David R. Bowler](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/professor-david-bowler). His research is focused on two areas: large-scale quantum mechanical simulations of condensed matter systems and the development of algorithms for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers.

Jack's first area of research involves simulating complex ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phenomena using large-scale and non-conventional implementations of density functional theory. His second area of research involves innovating new hybrid quantum-classical machine learning algorithms and experimenting with the deployment of financial algorithms like portfolio optimization and diversification to various quantum computing platforms. He uses advanced error mitigation techniques to bring forward the era where solving problems using quantum computers becomes practical.

## Open Source Projects

Jack contributes to and maintains several open source software projects including:

1. [CONQUEST](http://www.order-n.org/): **C**oncurrent $\mathcal{O}(N)$ **QU**antum **E**lectronic **ST**ructure. A large-scale density functional theory code capable of simulating millions of atoms spread accross millions of physical cores on large supercomputers. \[[Github](https://github.com/OrderN/CONQUEST-release)\].

2. [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/): Atomic Simulation Environment. A set of tools and Python modules for setting up, manipulating, running, visualizing and analyzing atomistic simulations. \[[Github](https://github.com/rosswhitfield/ase)\] \[[Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/ase/ase)\].

3. [Covalent](https://www.covalent.xyz/): A Pythonic workflow tool for computational scientists, AI/ML software engineers, and anyone who needs to run experiments on limited or expensive computing resources including quantum computers, HPC clusters, GPU arrays and cloud services. \[[Github](https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent)\].

4. [Pennylane](https://pennylane.ai/): A software framework for differentiable quantum programming, similar to TensorFlow and PyTorch for classical computation. It facilitates the training of variational quantum circuits and is particularly useful for quantum machine learning research. \[[Github](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane)\].
