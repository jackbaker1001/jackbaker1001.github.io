My name is Jack S. Baker and i'm a physicist specializing in the areas of quantum and classical computational physics, condensed matter theory and machine learning. I graduated from the [University of Leicester](https://le.ac.uk/) with a MPhys in Physics & Nanotechnology and went on to graduate with a Ph.D. in Computational Quantum Physics at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) & the [London Centre for Nanotechnology](https://www.london-nano.com/) under the supervision of [Prof. David R. Bowler](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/professor-david-bowler).

 My research focuses on two key areas. The first is **large-scale quantum mechanical simulations of condensed matter systems** using non-conventional implementations of density functional theory. In simulating systems comprised of thousands of atoms on high performance computers (HPC), I provide insights into the nature of complex ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phenomena including the sturcture of domains and the characterization of topological polar textures.

 The second area is in the **development of algorithms targeting noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers**. I innovate new hybrid quantum-classical machine learning algorithms for kernel methods and supervised/unsupervised classification using novel hybrid neural network architectures. Using quantum optimization methods, I experiment with the deployment of financial algorithms like portfolio optimization and diversification to various quantum computing platforms. Using advanced error mitigation techniques, I squeeze as much performance as possible from present hardware to bring forward the era of practical use of quantum computers.
