Jack S. Baker is a physicist specializing in quantum and classical computational physics, condensed matter theory, and machine learning. He earned his MPhys in Physics & Nanotechnology from the [University of Leicester](https://le.ac.uk/) and completed his Ph.D. in Computational Quantum Physics at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) & the [London Centre for Nanotechnology](https://www.london-nano.com/) under the supervision of [Prof. David R. Bowler](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/professor-david-bowler). His research is focused on two areas: large-scale quantum mechanical simulations of condensed matter systems and the development of algorithms for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers.

Jack's first area of research involves simulating complex ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phenomena using large-scale and non-conventional implementations of density functional theory. His second area of research involves innovating new hybrid quantum-classical machine learning algorithms and experimenting with the deployment of financial algorithms like portfolio optimization and diversification to various quantum computing platforms. He uses advanced error mitigation techniques to bring forward the era of practical use of quantum computers.
