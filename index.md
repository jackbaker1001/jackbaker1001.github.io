Jack S. Baker is a physicist specializing in quantum and classical computational physics, condensed matter theory, and machine learning. He earned his MPhys in Physics & Nanotechnology from the [University of Leicester](https://le.ac.uk/) and completed his Ph.D. in Computational Quantum Physics at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) & the [London Centre for Nanotechnology](https://www.london-nano.com/) under the supervision of [Prof. David R. Bowler](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/professor-david-bowler). He is presently employed as a Quantum Algorithms Researcher for [Agnostiq](https://agnostiq.ai/). His previous employments include [McLaren Formula 1](https://mclarenapplied.com/) where he worked on machine learning applied to biotechnologies and [Diamond Light Source](https://www.diamond.ac.uk) where he worked on nanoscale measurement techniques. His present research is mainly focused on two areas: large-scale quantum mechanical simulations of condensed matter systems and the development of machine learning and optimization algorithms suitable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers.

## Open Source Projects

Jack contributes to and maintains several open source software projects including:

1. [CONQUEST](http://www.order-n.org/): **C**oncurrent <b>O(N)</b> **QU**antum **E**lectronic **ST**ructure. A large-scale density functional theory code capable of simulating millions of atoms spread accross millions of physical cores on large supercomputers. \[[Github](https://github.com/OrderN/CONQUEST-release)\].

2. [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/): Atomic Simulation Environment. A set of tools and Python modules for setting up, manipulating, running, visualizing and analyzing atomistic simulations. \[[Github](https://github.com/rosswhitfield/ase)\] \[[Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/ase/ase)\].

3. [Covalent](https://www.covalent.xyz/): A Pythonic workflow tool for computational scientists, AI/ML software engineers, and anyone who needs to run experiments on limited or expensive computing resources including quantum computers, HPC clusters, GPU arrays and cloud services. \[[Github](https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent)\].

4. [Pennylane](https://pennylane.ai/): A software framework for differentiable quantum programming, similar to TensorFlow and PyTorch for classical computation. It facilitates the training of variational quantum circuits and is particularly useful for quantum machine learning research. \[[Github](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane)\]. See also the quantum machine learning tutorials and demos \[[Github](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/qml)\].
