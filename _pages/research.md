Broadly speaking, if quantum theory can be advantageously used or applied to a domain, I will pursue it. This can be considered the unifying theme of my research interests, joining together the trifecta of large-scale first principles simulations of solids, quantum machine learning and quantum optimization under the same banner. The first of these topics was covered in my Ph.D. research. I used massively parallel density functional functional theory codes on large supercomputers to simulate ferroelectric and antiferroelectric systems of unprecedented scale. These simulations provided accurate charecterizations of topological polar textures and revealed new phase transition behaviour in antiferroelectrics. I am still involved in this area, but now spend most of my time ideating and implementing new algorithms for noisy intermediate scale quantum computers. In particular, I am interested in using quantum machine learning and optimization in materials science and finance applications. Lastly, from the perspective of pure computational science, I am working towards the realization of the much anticipated joining of classical high performance computing and quantum hardware.
