My teaching philosophy centers around the belief that learning in the physical sciences is most effective when students actively engage in hands-on projects, particularly within the realm of programming. I firmly believe that undertaking these projects not only develops technical skills but also fosters a deeper understanding of concepts and nurtures cognitive connections within physics and mathematics. By immersing students in project-based learning experiences, I aim to create an environment where they can explore and apply theoretical knowledge in practical ways. Students develop problem-solving skills, critical thinking abilities, and gain a sense of accomplishment as they witness the direct application of physics principles. Moreover, such projects encourage collaboration, creativity, and curiosity, empowering students to actively construct their own knowledge and develop a lifelong passion for both computer science and physics.

  <h2 id="advocacy">Education Advocacy and Research</h2>
  <p>Educators should strive to achieve a world where access to education is maximized and equalized for all and should be looking for new and innovative ways to deliver education. In recent years, I have made my contributions to this goal by volunteering in education programs and conducting fundamental science education research. Ongoing projects are summarized below: </p>

<ul>
<li><b>Original Research by Young Twinkle Students (ORBYTS)</b>: ORBYTS is a <a href="https://www.orbyts.org/">multi-award winning science outreach and education program</a>. The goal of the ORBYTS project is two-fold: (1) To widen access to physics & chemistry education particulary focussing on promoting participation from women and other under represented groups in STEM. (2) To have students participate in peer-reviewed science and answer education research questions related to different age groups abilities to do so. I participated in this program for two years as a tutor but remain an advocate. Check out the education research articles I was involved with: [<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6552/aa8f2a/meta"> Phys. Educ. 2018</a>] [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/astrogeo/atx169"> A&G Mag. 2017</a>] </li><br><br>

<li><b>Pak-UK Education Gateway</b>: The <a href="https://www.britishcouncil.pk/programmes/education/higher-education/pak-uk-education-gateway">Pak-UK Education Gateway</a> aims to enhance partnership between the higher education sectors of Pakistan and the UK. Key areas of collaboration under this umbrella framework are: innovative and collaborative research, higher education leadership, quality assurance and standard setting, distance learning, international mobility and transnational education. I have travelled to Pakistan as an advocate for this program and continue to support its success. The trip was documented by <a href="https://iconn2019.lums.edu.pk/">Lahore University of Management Sciences</a> and <a href="http://pu.edu.pk/home/section/allpress/10034">University of the Punjab</a>. </li>

<p>I have delievered undergraduate level lectures at summer schools in the UK. The scope of these lectures was to provide a spring-board into the first year of undergraduate physics, chemistry and computer science.</p> <br><br>


<ul>
<li><b>Debtate Chamber: Introduction to Computer Science</b>:
I designed and delivered a week-long lecture series on introductory topics in computer science for <a href="https://debatechamber.com/summerschools/">Debate Chamber Summer Schools</a>. This course covered introductory logic, the history of computer science, complexity analysis, programming in Java and smartphone app design. </li><br><br>

<li><b>Original Research by Young Twinkle Students (ORBYTS): diatomic constants</b>:</li> After my first year of being an ORBYTS tutor (detailed in the previous section), I supervised and lectured students on molecular physics in the first ORBYTS summer school. This school focussed on building research skills to create a database of molecular diatomic constants. This course covered techniques for organizing and digesting scientific literature, presentation skills and vibrational properties of molecules. 
</ul>
