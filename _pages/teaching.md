My teaching philosophy centers around the belief that learning in the physical sciences is most effective when students actively engage in hands-on projects, particularly within the realm of programming. I firmly believe that undertaking these projects not only develops technical skills but also fosters a deeper understanding of concepts and nurtures cognitive connections within physics and mathematics. By immersing students in project-based learning experiences, I aim to create an environment where they can explore and apply theoretical knowledge in practical ways. Students develop problem-solving skills, critical thinking abilities, and gain a sense of accomplishment as they witness the direct application of physics principles. Moreover, such projects encourage collaboration, creativity, and curiosity, empowering students to actively construct their own knowledge and develop a lifelong passion for both computer science and physics.

  I have several years of experience teaching undergraduate and graduate level physics courses at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a>. While my role in each course varied, in general, I gave lectures, led problem solving seminars, guided students through practical workshops and marked coursework material. The relevant course codes are provided below with a short description and are linked to the full course content: <br>

<ul>

<li><b>Practical Physics and Computing 1 (PHAS0007)</b>: A two-term course with programming elements and a practical laboratory component. I taught this course for two consecutive years. [<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/practical-physics-and-computing-1-PHAS0007">Full course description</a>]</li><br><br>

<li><b>Practical Physics and Computing 2 (PHAS0029)</b>: A sequel to PHAS0007 above, but covering more advanced topics in the second year undergraduate course. I taught the computing component of this course for two consecutive years. [<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/practical-physics-and-computing-2-PHAS0029">Full course description</a>]</li><br><br>

<li><b>Computational Physics (PHAS0030)</b>: An advanced third year course in computational physics aimed at providing students with a deep understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of numerical simulations and an introduction to research software engineering. [<a href="https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/info.php?id=6767">Full course description</a>]</li><br><br>

<li><b>Practical Skills 1P (PHAS0008)</b>: A one term course which is a sequel to the above. This course focuses on practical laboratory skills. I also taught this course for two consecutive years. [<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/practical-skills-1p-PHAS0008">Full course description</a>]</li><br><br>

<li><b>Practical Physics 2A (PHAS0028)</b>. A sequel to PHAS0008 above, also covering more advanced topics in the second year. [<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/practical-physics-2a-PHAS0028">Full course description</a>]</li><br><br>

<li><b>Solid State Physics (PHAS0041)</b>: A third year option module covering electronic and magnetic properties of materials. [<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/solid-state-physics-PHAS0041">Full course description</a>]</li><br><br>

<li><b>Advanced Quantum Field Theory (MSci 4245/QMUL PHY7007U/P)</b>: A Masterâ€™s level course in quantum field theory. This course also allowed participants from Queen Mary University London.

  <p>I travel within Canada and overseas to deliver workshops and tutorials on quantum algorithms, machine learning and heterogeneous workflow orchestration. Recent events are listed below with a link to content if available. 
  <ul>

  <li><b>Orchestrating and Managing Quantum Machine Learning Workflows with Covalent</b>: IEEE Quantum week, Broomfield, Colorado (2022). Learn how to use <a href="https://www.covalent.xyz">Covalent</a> to manage a run experiments to study the differences between classical and quantum methods for similarity learning of images.[<a href="https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/tutorials_covalent_ieee_2022">Github</a>]</li><br><br>

  <li><b>Interdisciplinary Quantum HACKathon (IQuHack)</b>: Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2023). We aim to bring students (high school through early-career professionals) from a diverse set of backgrounds to explore improvements and applications of near-term quantum devices. I contributed as a virtual competition judge. [<a href="https://www.iquise.mit.edu/">Web</a>] [<a href="https://github.com/iquhack">Github</a>]</li><br><br>

  <li><b>Practical Quantum Machine Learning: Time Series Analysis with Pennylane and Covalent</b>:
  IEEE Quantum week, Bellevue, Washington (2023). Learn how to analyze time-series data using hybrid quantum-classical machine learning techniques utilizing <a href="https://www.pennylane.ai">Pennylane</a> and <a href="https://www.covalent.xyz">Covalent</a>. <i>Github link coming soon</i></li>
